# Credit-Score-Classification
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness.
There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:  Good Standard Poor A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.
It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness and reduce the chances of fraud from its culstomers.
I have used Random Forest algorithm to classify the customer based on their credit history in the database. 

The following graphs are used to get idea relational between the variables
